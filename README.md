**# Self-Generating-Thinking-Engine**
Prototype of autonomous thinking engine based on self-questioning, self-doubt, and exploration

## Overview
This project proposes a prototype of the **Self-Generating Thinking Engine v2.0**, an AI cognitive system capable of autonomously generating thought flows, questioning its own reasoning, and evolving through exploration.

A key innovation is the **Multi-Self System**, where three internal selves (Existing Knowledge Self, Doubting Self, Exploring Self) interact to regulate and enrich thought processes.

## Features
- **Self-Questioning**: Autonomous generation of new thoughts based on existing knowledge
- **Self-Doubting**: Critical evaluation of thoughts to detect conflicts
- **Exploration Trigger**: Dynamic exploration of new ideas when internal conflict exceeds thresholds
- **Memory Recording**: Structured recording of thought evolution
- **Multi-Self System**: Internalized self-regulation via Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis dynamic

## Architecture
```
KnowledgeBase → SelfQuestioning → SelfDoubting → [if Conflict High → Exploration] → Memory
```

## Installation

# Python 3.10+ recommended
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

```

## Usage
